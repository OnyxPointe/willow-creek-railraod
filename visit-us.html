        <p class="editable">
            WCRR was founded in 1975, as a place where live steamers could gather to share their interests in trains and enjoy outdoor miniature railroading.
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            We are dedicated to providing a historical account of what early steam and diesel railroading was like &ndash; the smells, sights and sounds &ndash; only on a smaller scale.
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            Our steam and diesel powered trains are 1:8 scale replicas - large enough for the whole family to ride!
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            We hope to see you soon! All aboard!
        </p>
